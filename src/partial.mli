(** Partial, lazy, functional streams; may terminate or may not.

    Streams are lazy data structures which contain values in
    sequence. Due to laziness, streams may be infinite (e.g. {!ints}
    below). The streams in this module are "partial" referring to the
    fact that {{!elimination}[eliminators]} like {!head},
    {!tail}, and {!uncons} return values wrapped in [option] producing
    [None] when if the stream contains no further values.

    The streams in the {!Total} module are a sister datatype to these
    streams which is "total", e.g. {!Total.uncons} returns pure
    values.

    Mathematically, partial streams are the greatest fixed point of
    the functor [F X = 1 + A * X].

(** Partial streams admit an empty value. *)

val cons : 'a -> 'a t -> 'a t
(** Extend a stream by prepending a value. *)

val unfold : ('s -> ('a * 's) option) -> ('s -> 'a t)
(** Lazily unfolds a partial stream. In each step of [unfold build s],
    the current seed is passed to [build] to produce either [None],
    indicating the stream has now terminated, or [Some (a, s')] giving
    the next value of the stream and the new seed value, e.g.

    {[ let ints : int t = unfold (fun n -> Some (n, n+1)) 0 ]}
*)

val trajectory : ('a -> 'a) -> ('a -> 'a t)
(** Generate an infinite stream from the trajectory of a
    endomorphism. In other words, [head (trajectory f a) = a] and

val impure : (unit -> 'a option) -> 'a t
(** Generates a list impurely. Each new value of the stream [impure f]
    is produced by calling [f ()] until it is [None]. See also
    {!tabulate}. *)

val of_list : 'a list -> 'a t
(** Lists can be seen as equivalent to necessarily finite
    streams. This function injects a list into the type of partial
    streams.

    In particular, a linked list is the least fixed point of the
    functor [F X = 1 + A * X], the same functor that partial streams
    are the greatest fixed point of.
*)

val of_total : 'a Internal.Total.t -> 'a t
(** As partial streams may be infinite we can inject total streams
    into them. *)

val tabulate : (int -> 'a option) -> 'a t
(** Generates a stream by tabulation of values. The generation
    proceeds sequentially such that the stream [tabulate f] is either
    infinite or has length equal to the {i first} [n] such that [f n =
    None].

    Partial streams can be seen as memoizations of functions of type
    [int -> 'a option] so long as the "compaction" property above
    holds. This correspondence is nicer for {!Total} streams (see
    {!Total.tabulate}).

    See {!nth}.

val uncons : 'a t -> ('a * 'a t) option
(** The "principle eliminator" for a stream. Can be used along with
    recursion to derive all of the others. The fact that the return

val fold : ('a -> 'r Lazy.t -> 'r) -> 'r -> ('a t -> 'r)
(** Non-strict right fold. If [f] is careful about forcing its second
    argument only as needed then [fold f z s] can return in finite
    time even when [s] is infinite.

    This is the principle recursor of a partial stream. Essentially
    any function eliminating streams can be derived from {!fold}.

    tail-recursive. *)

(** Impure consumption of a stream. If the end of the stream is
    reached then the [finally] callback will be invoked. {i This
