(** Total, lazy, functional streams; guaranteed to be unending.

    Streams are lazy data structures which contain values in
    sequence. Due to laziness, streams may be infinite (e.g. {!ints}
    below). The streams in this module are "total" referring to the
    fact that {{!elimination}[eliminators]} like {!head}, {!tail}, and
    {!uncons} return pure values implying that there is never an end
    to the sequence of contained values.

    The streams in {!Partial} are a sister datatype to these streams
    which is "partial", e.g. {!Partial.uncons} returns values wrapped
    in [option].

    Mathematically, total streams are the greatest fixed point of the
    functor [F X = A * X].

val cons : 'a -> 'a t -> 'a t
(** Extend a stream by prepending a value. *)

val unfold : ('s -> 'a * 's) -> ('s -> 'a t)
(** Lazily unfolds a total stream. In each step of [unfold build s],
    the current seed is passed to [build] the next value of the stream
    and the new seed value, e.g.

    {[ let ints : int t = unfold (fun n -> (n, n+1)) 0 ]}

(** Generate an infinite stream from the trajectory of a
    endomorphism. In other words, [head (trajectory f a) = a] and
    [tail (trajectory f a) = trajectory f (f a)] *)

val impure : (unit -> 'a) -> 'a t
(** Generates a list impurely. Each new value of the stream [impure f]
    is produced by calling [f ()]. See also {!tabulate}. *)

val tabulate : (int -> 'a) -> 'a t
(** Generates a stream by tabulation of values.

    Total streams can be seen as memoizations of functions of type
    [int -> 'a], so {!tabulate} witnesses part of this isomorphism.

    See {!nth}.

val uncons : 'a t -> ('a * 'a t)
(** The "principle eliminator" for a stream. Can be used along with
    recursion to derive all of the others. *)

val fold : ('a -> 'r Lazy.t -> 'r) -> ('a t -> 'r)
(** Non-strict right fold. One must be careful in [f] about forcing
    the second argument only as needed; [fold f z s] {i can} return in
    finite time, but won't if it is too strict.

    This is the principle recursor of a total stream. Essentially any
    function eliminating streams can be derived from {!fold}.

(** Interleaves two streams *)
val interleave : 'a t -> 'a t -> 'a t
(** Interleaves two streams, non-associative. For instance, the
